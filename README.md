This little App was created while practicing and working on improving my skills in React.
My main focus in the project was on

<ul>  
  <li>Adding Features to existing code</li>
  <li>Features:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Sync notes with localStorage</li>
        <li>Add note summary titles</li>
        <li>Move modified notes to top of the list</li>
        <li>Delete notes</li>
      </ul>
  <li>Adding Firebase</li>
  <li>Debouncing</li>
</ul>
